# 3ButtonServoController
Sets up to 16 servos to 0 90 or 180 degrees based on specific button push


This requires the following Hardware:

3 x 1k resistors (I have been advised you can leave these out)
3 x pushbuttons
Arduino compatible board, I used a Nano clone
PCA6985 16 channel 12 Servo driver board (example https://www.adafruit.com/product/815 )
6V external power source
